## Summary
    This project explores whether or not housing prices in major oil towns in the U.S. are capable of predicting oil prices. The hope is to be able to build a model trained on hisorical house prices in oil towns that can determine patterns in house prices that may be indicative of a looming crash in oil prices. 

## Breakdown
	- One notebook that covers cleaning and transforming the data.
	- Data cleaning section looks at various issues inherent to this data set such as data shape and working date time data types.
	- The encoding section deals with encoding the categorical data so that the machine learning algorithims can process the 
        data.
	- Finally, the modeling section looks at modeling using Facebook Prophet, a timeseries algorithm developed by Facebook. This algorithm 
	will be used to attempt to forecast house prices in order to see if they correlate with changes in oil price!
